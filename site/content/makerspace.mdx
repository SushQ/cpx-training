## Motivation

![Alt text here](./images/learning.jpg)

<div className="grid">
  <section className="column">
    In order to fill the tech- and science-focused roles of the future,
    technologists nationwide should focus on providing youth from
    underserved communities the resources to promote computer science
    advocacy now.

    Students from underprivileged backgrounds are 8 to 10 times more likely
    to pursue college degrees in computer science if they have taken AP
    computer science in high school. We can project that these odds will
    only increase if studentds are given even earlier exposure to software
    and hardware technologies.

    Through this Maker workshop, technologists who are passionate about
    bridging this gap will develop a blueprint that can be leveraged to
    facilitate tech exploration workshops for underserved youth in their
    communities. Marrying knowledge of Python programming and Adafruit
    Circuit Playground Express devices, their students will be empowered to
    become makers of technology.
