    <h3>What is the Circuit Playgroud Express?</h3>

    The Circuit Playgroud Express is an all-in-one circuit board featuring a processor, sensors, LEDs, USB and more that you can program:

    <ul>
        <li>10 Mini NeoPixel LEDs</li>
        <li>Accelerometer</li>
        <li>Temperature Sensor</li>
        <li>Light Sensor</li>
        <li>Sound Sensor</li>
        <li>Infrared Transmitter / Receiver</li>
        <li>Mini Speaker</li>
        <li>Two Push Buttons</li>
        <li>Slide Switch</li>
        <li>Seven Touch Pads</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Do I Need?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Your Circuit Playgroud Express</li>
        <li>
            [MU Editor](https://codewith.mu/)
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Getting Going</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>After downloading the MU Editor link above, install it.</li>
        <li>
        You will need to install CircuitPython on to your CPX board
        extra detail [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-circuitpython).
        <ul>
            <li>
            Go to the [CircuitPython site](https://circuitpython.org/board/circuitplayground_express/) and follow the download steps for the latest stable release.
            </li>
            <li>
            Connect your Circuit Playgroud Express to your computer via USB and press the reset button.
            </li>
            <li>
            The device should display as a Disk Drive named CPLAYBOOT
            if instead it appears as CIRCUITPY, skip ahead to step 3.
            </li>
            <li>
            Find the .uf2 CircuitPython file you downloaded; drag and
            drop it onto the CPLAYBOOT drive this will install
            CircuitPython on your CPX.
            </li>
            <li>
            Wait for a few seconds, the lights should flash and the
            device should reconnect and reappear named CIRCUITPY.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
        Launch the MU Editor
        <ul>
            <li>Choose Adafruit CircuitPython mode.</li>
            <li>
            Save your code to the CIRCUITPY disk and name it main.py.
            </li>
            <li>
            Make sure that any code.txt or code.py files that exist on
            your CIRCUITPY disk are removed or renamed. If files named
            code.txt or code.py exist on your CIRCUITPY disk, your code
            in main.py will not run.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>More on Mu Editor</h3>

        Choose the Adafruit CircuitPython mode for this session. Some version of Mu list the Adafruit CircuitPython as CircuitPython, either will work for this session. There are other modes you can choose to explore here later in your own time!

        Mu Editor has a 'checker' button which checks that your code can be understood correctly and will highlight any errors.

        The Serial button listens to your CPX board for any data being emitted. It can be used in conjunction with the Plotter to show this data graphically.
